#A.W.E.S.O.M - O
## The aswesome time tracker!

The time protocol is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/brunnurs/awesom-o/wiki/Worklog)


## How to use the application?

### Track time
log in. Choose from/to time with the datetime-picker. Choose a project (create projects from the entities-menu if necessary). Press the button! (**attention**: currently there is no validation for negative time spans. So enter real times!)

### See statistics
Choose the menu point Statistics... nothing special here :-)


### Track time for a subsidiary
First we need to create a subsidiary relation. Log in as _user_ and go to Entities --> Subsidiary. Create a Subsidiary where the _admin_ is parent and _user_ is child (you can ofc use other accounts).
Now log out and log in again, but this time as admin (admin/pw:admin). Navigate to the home-screen (default) and you can now choose if you would like to track time for yourself or for the Subsidiary (in this case the user _user_)

### Approve worklog
Use the generated work-log dialog (Entities --> Work Log) to set the "approved" flag.
